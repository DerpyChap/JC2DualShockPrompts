# JC2DualShockPrompts
Adds DualShock button prompts to Just Cause 2, accomplished by copying the button icon values from the PlayStation 3 version of the game.

## Installation
[Download the zip file from the releases](https://github.com/DerpyChap/JC2DualShockPrompts/releases/download/latest/JC2DualShockPrompts.zip) and extract the `JC2DualShockPrompts` folder to the game directory's `dropzone` folder (create one if you don't have one already).

The final path to the file should look something like this: `../steamapps/common/Just Cause 2/dropzone/JC2DualShockPrompts/text/button_prompts.csv`.

## Notes
Not all prompts have been replaced, most notably the D-Pad that appears when switching weapons and the LT/RT prompts on the map screen. The control settings in the menus also still reference the Xbox 360 controller. As far as I can tell, though, everything else has been swapped, including all A/B/X/Y prompts being swapped with their DualShock counterparts (X/O/□/∆).
